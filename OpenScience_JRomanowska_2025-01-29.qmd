Questions in Mentimeter:

- Do you agree with following statements...
- What do you associate with "Open Science"? _(word cloud)_
- What techniques do you practice? _(order several activities)_
- What techniques do you know of? _(order several activities)_

:::

## Reproducible research

Be open about:

- analysis steps
- inputs, outputs
- code used to generate each figure
- notes
- versions of software, packages, etc.

> **Share all that can be shared!**

## Task

What would help make these steps reproducible?

:::{.incremental}
- receiving data (first look)
- data exploration
- analysis
- visualizations
- preparing paper
- submitting paper and data    
:::

:::notes

- receiving data (first look)    
_copy and store original data untouched!_
- data exploration    
_tidy data_
- analysis    
_make scripts and functions_
- visualizations    
_use scripts, don't change the graph by hand!_
- preparing paper    
_(will be talking about this today!) Rmarkdown_
- submitting paper and data    
_create a repository, share_

:::

## Open Data

- not only _raw input data!_

:::notes
We're usually not allowed to share our input data, if these come from health
surveys, health registries, MoBa, genetic measurements, etc.

_However_, we can always share something!
:::

. . .

- _all_ results

:::notes
Have you considered what to include in a paper where the space is limited?
Have you ever thought about how "open" this is?

What did you do with all the other results you produced? How about just sharing
all that your analyses give out _and_ the code you used to obtain these?
:::

. . .

- accessible by anyone

:::notes
So you've created many tables and published them in supplementary material?
Wonderful! Have you ever thought about how "open" this is?
:::

## Example {.center}

:::notes
**Look at these files:**

1. Word document with a stylized table - nice to _watch_, not nice to _work with_
2. Excel spreadsheet with _two_ tables in one sheet
3. CSV file and meta-data

The first two are in `extras` folder, the last ones are on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jromanowska/Norwegian_drug_screening_ATC_level2/tree/main/DATA).

**Questions:**

Which one do you prefer?

Which one is easiest to incorporate in analyses as input?

Which one is easiest to open?
:::

## Exercise

1. export to a text-file

2. create a table in R/STATA

3. describe your data

4. put on GitHub/Dataverse


## Good practice {.center}

1. Share _all_ that you can share

. . .

2. Describe your data

. . .

3. Create text-files, not Excel or Word

. . .

4. (*) Public repository + license
